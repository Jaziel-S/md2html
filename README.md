# md2html
## change markdown into a single html file:
here is the python code written by copilot.
and i also try to generate a exe from it;
it could be very useful if u r gonna share ur markdown file with someone who dont have a markdown reader.I asked copilot to insert images into html as a Base64-encoded data,so u could just share one single html file instead of a zip of pics.
