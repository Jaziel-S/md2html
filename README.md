# md2html
## change markdown into a single html file: by Jaziel_S
here is the python code written by copilot. 
and i also try to generate a exe from it; 
it could be very useful if u r gonna share ur markdown file with someone who dont have a markdown reader. I asked copilot to insert images into html as a Base64-encoded data, so u could just share one single html file instead of a zip of pics. 
---
## How to use it
download the exe, double click it and a window pops up allowing u 2 choose ur markdown file. Then here comes the html file. Yes just easy and simple as shit. no worry about security or u could have a look at the source code by downloading the .py file.
